   // Write a simple cash register class.
     //   Each cash register should keep track of the number of items checked out and the total cash in the register.
       // We are only concerned with the number of items to check out and their prices. No need to handle item names, SKUs, taxes, etc...
        //It should have the following methods (use static when appropriate):
        //checkout( )
        //Takes two forms. If there is only one parameter that is the cash received and there is only one item checked
// out. If it has two parameters, the first parameter should have the number of items checked out and the second
// parameter is the price per item.
        //cashout( )
        //Reset the number of items and total cash to zero for a cash register
        //getItems( )
        //Returns the number of items in the cash register
        //getTotalCash( )
        //Returns the total cash in the cash register
        //getAveragePricePerItem( )
        //Returns the average price per item checked out by the cash register
        //getRegisterCount( )
        //Returns the number of cash registers created
        //getAllItems( )
        //Returns the total number of items for all cash registers
        //getAllTotalCash( )
        //Returns the total cash for all cash registers
        //For your main method, write some code to test your cash register class. Instantiate at least two cash register
// objects and check out a few items for each cash register.
        //It should then print for each cash register:
        //the total items
        //total cash
        //average price per item
        //And finally, it should print:
        //the number of cash registers created
        //the total items checked out for all cash registers
        //the total cash for all cash registers
